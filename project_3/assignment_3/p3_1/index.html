    My favorite resturant is Chili's for a variety of reasons. I think they have the best grilled food att
	Chili's and you can get a lot of their fantastic grilled food for really good prices as well. For example, you can 
	have a mix and match deal for about $19.00 - $20.00 or so.

    My favorite meal to get at Chili's are their chicken quesadillas with fries. I love getting that meal for a variety of reasons. 
	The sauce I get for my quesadillas are fantastic. I also believe that Chili's has the best Mexican food as well.
